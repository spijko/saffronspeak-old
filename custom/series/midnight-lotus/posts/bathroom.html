<b>Today we're</b> bringing Midnight Lotus into the bath to create a rich, global space that will invite you to breathe deeply and pamper yourself.  We'll build the room around our hand printed, <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=64">100% cotton Midnight Lotus shower curtain</a> which highlights a pattern of elegant lotus blossoms intertwined in cobalt blue and white.  You'll see it all come together when we play around with these basic colors and add natural accents inspired by the organic shapes of our curtain!  Let's take a look.

<h3>Bath Towels <span>and Mat</span></h3>

<b>Essentials</b> in the bath, towels should be soft, absorbant and fit well into the design of the room.  The towels I've chosen in this scenario don't "pop out", but rather do their jobs well, and add dimension to the color scheme.  My favorites are linen towels that just get softer with each wash...  West Elm's cotton Dhurrie rug would add style to any room, but is a nice surprise in the bath, and a big upgrade from mats made of rubber-backed shag carpeting!

<h3>Wall Decor <span>and Mirrors</span></h3>

<b>I'm basically</b> in love with all of these accessories... simple, versatile and hinting of far off places.  Use Pottery Barn's Eleanor mirrors in a grouping (as shown) for big impact, or use around the room to surround yourself with light.  Hooks are so convenient in the bath, for robes, wash clothes, etc.; why settle for something run of the mill and boring?  I love the patinad look of Anthropologie's Bract hook.  Even the details play a part in our bath, don't they? Finally, to build our global theme, I like the look of Ballard Design's Patchwork Prints. (Please note that if you can find a group of small metal frames, you could easily make your own with scrapbook paper!)

<h3>Accessories</h3>

<b>Since baths</b> are often rather tiny, accessories should be hard working, and lovely.  The three I've chosen for our Midnight Lotus bath are just that!  The Metal Spa Counter Caddy from Viva Terra will keep your space tidy, and in high style.  I would definitely copy their idea of including flowers in the set up!  A warm, organic wood shower stool is handy for everything from shower seating (great for shaving!) to stacking a pile of extra towels for guests.  West Elm's Blue and White bath set was just <em>made</em> to live with our Midnight Lotus shower curtain.  I love the look, and again - little trays like this make it so much easier to keep a neat look.

<h3>Sensories</h3>

<b>Of course,</b> we love our fragrant pampering <em>most</em> in the bath!  To that end, I 've sourced a few delights that are just out of the ordinary, and will add layers of "ooh" to your space.  Mint, rosemary, berry and spice come together to transport you (and clean you!) in Soap Goddess' "Starlit Sky Soap".  Add a little Lotus Blossom and Water Lily Bath   Oil to your soak, and you'll emerge sensual, soft and smelling great!  Of course, if you're lounging in the tub, you should go all the way and light an aromatic candle like Wisteria's Sea Salt candle.

Oh my.  This sounds amazing!
