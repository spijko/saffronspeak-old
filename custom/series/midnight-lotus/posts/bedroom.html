<b>Blue is a</b> magical color - somehow calming <em>and</em> invigorating, both peaceful and cheery.  Our <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=21_35&amp;products_id=28">bright blue and white Midnight Lotus</a> is alive with this magic.  I particularly love its use in a bedroom, because this is certainly a place that requires soothing notes along with bright ones.  Remember that this print is available in both a single sheet bedspread, and a duvet cover, depending on how much weight and warmth you want on your bed.

We'll take a look around the bedroom today, and using our hand printed Midnight Lotus as an anchor piece, create a serene space that you'll love to live in.

<h3>Wall Colors</h3>

<b>For our</b> Midnight Lotus bedroom, I've highlighted three paint ideas from Lullaby Paints, maker of non-toxic, no VOC, odorless paints.  Each color will take the room in a different direction, so play away with your unique vision!  <strong>Royal Blue</strong> should probably be saved for an accent wall, but oh what a pop that would be!  White accessories on that wall would be crisp, clean and bold.  I'm drawn to pale green walls in this room, and <strong>Celadon</strong> is right on target.  This color acts as an interesting neutral and allows you to play up the "zen" nature of our lotus print.  <strong>Azure Sea</strong> moves you in the direction of a beachy, Mediterranean look and is so young and fresh.

<h3>Wall Decor</h3>

<b>Now that</b> your walls are singing with new color, let's dress them a bit!  I've chosen a range of pieces that are playful, global and romantic.  Choose one to tease out the kind of blue room that you'll sleep well in.  A trio of Pink Pagoda's Chinoiserie prints could be arranged as a faux headboard, and Z Gallerie's hanging mirrors would certainly be an eye catcher (and a light catcher) across from your window.  A small botanical painting of lotus flowers on a side table will make a lovely (and correct!) connection to your Midnight Lotus duvet.

<h3>Pouf <span>and Pillows</span></h3>

<b>I'm pretty</b> sure that by now, you know how I feel about pillows.  They're the best!  They are so versatile, bright and (often) well priced that you can really play around and experiment.  The colors!  The textures!  The patterns!  Along with gorgeous throws, I have included a lovely pouf from West Elm.  I have a huge crush on this piece, and am currently daydreaming about all the ways I'd use it in my bedroom...  book table, child sized chair, feet up....

<h3>Accessories, <span>Lighting, and Furniture</span></h3>

<b>While big</b> purchases like furniture and light fixtures might be on your Pinterest board and not in your immediate plans, it's worthwhile to grab some great inspiration and style your room around it.  Honestly, I can't even believe how gorgeous  the Crown light and the Honeycomb chest would be together.  They would add just the right subtle-but-high style to your Midnight Lotus bedroom.  Pinterest board dreams aside, I'm a big fan of building a look around affordable collectables like Wisteria's cobalt bottles.  Gather a few, add some more eclectic pieces, and over time create just the look you want.

<h3>Sensories</h3>

<b>Finally,</b> a few ideas for ambiance and fragrance once your space is done!  Of course, we have to go with the lotus theme here.  Fill your room with the light floral scent of lotus accompanied by the freshness of the sea air with a reed diffuser from Yankee Candle Company.   When you're ready for a bit of romance (or for kicking your feet up on your pouf and reading a good book!) why not illuminate with an artisan made lotus candle holder - that doubles as a wine stopper!  Sounds like a great room, huh?
