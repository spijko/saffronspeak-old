<b>Oh friends,</b> I think this may be one of my favorite rooms in <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/collection_page.php?cPath=59&amp;model=M_LOTUS&amp;products_id=555">Midnight Lotus</a>.  (And that's no small feat, since I love the <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/blog/design-resources-blue-and-white-global-bath/">bath</a> and <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/blog/design-resources-blue-and-white-bedroom-with-midnight-lotus-2/">bedroom</a> too!)  Somehow, there's a convergence of bright, simple, floral, boho, cheerful and fresh that really comes through in our blue and white dining room.  Color pairings are streamlined (blue, white, silver and hot pink) so the action in the room is played out by texture, pattern and hue.  Come in and see what we've done with the place!

<h3>Tableware</h3>

<b>Whether</b> you choose a Midnight Lotus <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_56&amp;products_id=354">table runner</a>, <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_45&amp;products_id=193">napkin set</a>, <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_52&amp;products_id=224">round</a> or <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_29&amp;products_id=81">rectangular tablecloth</a> (all hand printed on 100% cotton), you'll set your table best with wonderful blue and white tableware.  Use <strong>highly patterned pieces</strong> if you are setting the table with a runner, or with our napkins.  Use <strong>fully white or bright blue pieces</strong> if you spread a tablecloth.

<h3>Centerpieces</h3>

<b>Silver</b> and pops of fuchsia or hot pink will fill out your table in a most winsome way.  I love <strong>small votives</strong> at a long table---you can see over them, and an assortment look elegant in a long line or an organic cluster.  Use a taller <strong>centerpiece like the pink peony </strong>one below at a round table.  Perhaps you could arrange flowers or fruits in a <strong>small silver pedestal bowl</strong> like the one from Hayneedle - this will add just the right amount of charm to your gathering!

<h3>Lighting</h3>

<b>Updating</b> lighting can be a daunting task, but I've sourced three ideas for your Midnight Lotus dining room that will add global chic in a hot second!  (Well, that's a slight exaggeration...).  The dandelion inspired <strong>Maskros Pendant from Ikea</strong> is (as are all things Ikea) all about the assembly.  Their downloadable instructions will walk even a novice through snapping it together, and into place.  If you're not up for all that, consider a simple <strong>table lamp with a great Ikat shade</strong> in blue and white!  And finally, if you don't even want to deal with electricity, add a few <strong>Moroccan Lanterns</strong> to your tablescape, light a candle, and consider it done.

<h3>Accessories</h3>

<b>Why do I</b> always love the accessories so much?  They're like icing on a cake---a bit superflous, but so pretty! <strong>Mirrors</strong> are almost a must in a dining room.  We want light, light, and more light and of course, mirrors invite all kinds of natural light to bounce around and settle to create ambiance.  In this lovely light room, let's tease out the lotus theme of our table linen by adding a stacking set of<strong> lotus plates</strong> to a side table or credenza---these are lovely and useful, too!  Under the table, add <strong>a statement rug</strong>.  <strong>Custom Cool Rugs</strong> is now one of my favorite shops - I could spend a long time dreaming about the huge variety of interesting rugs they offer!  If you don't love the one I've highlighted, check out their site!  You're sure to find something you like.

<h3><span>Putting it</span> All Together</h3>

<b>Finally,</b> let's take a look at how these elements work together in your space.  Like I said, this is one of my favorite scenarios.  What do you think?  What else would you include?  (And are you already planning your Midnight Lotus dinner party? :)  )
