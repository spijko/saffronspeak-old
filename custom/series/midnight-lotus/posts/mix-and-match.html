<b>We've collected</b> quite a few beautiful blue looks with our exotic-fresh <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/M_LOTUS/555/asian-blue-white-floral-bedding-table-linens.php">Midnight Lotus</a> print.  Say you've decided you'd like to use it in a space (bedroom, bath, kitchen, living room), and would like to see how it works with other hand printed Saffron Marigold linens.  Ideally you'll purchase a few <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/directory.php?cPath=58">generously sized swatches</a> to play around with, but first, you may like to take a look at this Mix and Match post which will highlight a few lovely combinations.

<h3><span>Midnight Lotus with</span> Blues &amp; Whites</h3>

<b>This is</b> probably the most intuitive look for Midnight Lotus. Personally, I just can't get away from blue, white and metallic for this print. (True, there's a hint of gold in both our <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/collection_page.php?cPath=59&amp;model=D_INDIA_NP&amp;products_id=777">Nizam's Pearls</a> and <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/V_GLACE/663/white-gold-romantic-bedding-drapery-table-linens.php">Vanilla Glacé</a>, but feel free to use gold or silver accessories with these patterns!)  Sticking with a blue and  white palette creates a really fresh, clean look that takes global and puts it in a clearly modern context.  If you want to really push blue and white, add an accent of our <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/M_TAJ/556/turquoise-white-indian-bedding-table-linens.php">Moonlit Taj </a>- almost the visual reverse of Midnight Lotus, as it is a white ground with blue florals.

<h3><span>Midnight Lotus with</span> Turquoise &amp; Yellow</h3>

<b>For a fun</b> and funky original look, bring the bright blue of Midnight Lotus along side a cheery yellow and a pop of turquoise.  This look says "happy, unique and free-spirited".  If that's you (or your daughter), then consider this combination!  In this Mix and Match, each print plays an important role, working together to build the whole look.  <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/D_PEACOCK/583/peacock-feather-print-bedding-table-linens.php">Dance O Peacock</a> picks up on all three colors at this party:  blue, turquoise and yellow.  <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/D_INDIA_JP/773/doi-turquoise-blue-gold-curtain-cushion-covers.php">Jeweled Peacock</a>, from our Dreams of India collection, provides a glowing foil to the richer blue of <strong>Midnight Lotus</strong>, and ties in perfectly to the aqua color in <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/M_DEW/557/yellow-blue-french-bedding-table-linens.php">Morning Dew</a>.  Of course, Morning Dew brings in a cheery yellow ground and  a hint of tangerine as well.

<h3><span>Midnight Lotus with</span> Browns &amp; Blues</h3>

<b>The beautiful</b> thing about blue is that it goes straight from fresh and modern to cool and natural, all with the swoosh of a <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/directory.php?cPath=58">swatch</a>. :)  Midnight Lotus along with  browns creates a  beachy, rich look that is at home in a master bedroom or a bohemian bath.  To create this look, choose from one of our sumptuous chocolate browns ( <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/D_INDIA_GC/771/doi-gilded-chocolate-curtain-cushion-covers.php">Gilded Chocolate</a> and <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=58&amp;products_id=701">For the Love of Chocolate</a>) and add <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/O_BREEZES/532/moroccan-blue-brown-beach-bedding-table-linens.php">Ocean Breezes</a> as a transitional piece.  This combination is especially nice if you already have lots of dark wood, leather furniture or beige-neutral walls.
