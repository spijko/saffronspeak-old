This year take a departure from traditional fall colors and go for the  bold jewel tones of purple, turquoise and fuchsia accented with ochre and ivory, in Sultan's Palace table linens. Thanksgiving is a tactile, visual celebration - the cozy feel of warm linens, rich foods on the palate, and sounds of love and laughter. Create a jewel toned table scape that is strong and dramatic enough to see you through it all.

We offer you tablecloths--both <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_29&amp;products_id=545">rectangular</a> and <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_52&amp;products_id=546">round</a>, as well as a <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_56&amp;products_id=544">runner</a> and <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_45&amp;products_id=547">napkins</a> in this collection.

Echoing the vanilla, rose and grape colors of the main tablecloth, it's a grown-up take on pink and purple.

<h3>Accessories and Recipes</h3>

Bohemian decor thrives on an almost irreverent attitude by layering rich color and mixing patterns. <strong>Accessorize</strong> with decor pieces infused with florals and bold color along with lots of colorful fabrics, like suzanis and paisley prints. Boho-chic decor is perfect for a home where you want to create a relaxed atmosphere.
