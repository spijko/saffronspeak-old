Our Moroccan Spice Route print could just not be more perfect for fall and Thanksgiving.  The rich, bold hues bring to mind visions of colorful, swirling leaves, and alternately, fragrant heaps of spices mounded at the market.  A sensory print to be sure, take it all in this season!

In addition to the tablecloths--both <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_29&amp;products_id=176">rectangular</a> and <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_52&amp;products_id=229">round</a> and a <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_56&amp;products_id=359">table runner</a><a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/directory.php?cPath=43_56">,</a>  we also have coordinating <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_45&amp;products_id=346">dinner napkins</a>.

We know that our customers are far from "one size fits all".  So along with our unique, handcrafted table linens, we'd like to share ideas for creating three distinct looks.  Of course, mixing and matching is always encouraged!

<h3>Table Linens</h3>
All of your friends will be dying to know your secrets - "Where on earth do you <em>find</em> such fabulously unique table linens"?  Since you're easy going, free-spirited and generous, you'll probably tell them that your linens are hand printed in India, and designed with love by Saffron Marigold.  Once your Spice Route tablecloth is glowing on the table, add any of these coordinating cotton dinner napkins for a look that's as interesting as you and your crowd.

<strong>1. <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_29&amp;products_id=176">Spice Route rustic red tablecloth</a></strong><strong>.</strong> This handprinted piece has a rich variety of tones, from burgundy to ocher, brighter reds and robin's egg blues.  There'<em>s lots</em> of room to play with this!

<strong>2.  <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_45&amp;products_id=346">Spice Route Dinner Napkins</a>.</strong>  For napkins that are perfectly coordinated, but dazzlingly different, choose our Spice Route dinner napkins.  A tribal chevron pattern catches your eye and moves into a wonderfully detailed deep blue and copper border.

<strong>3.  <a href="http://www.cb2.com/uno-natural-linen-napkin/s274863?a=501&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;matchtype=&amp;gclid=CLj2nN2LkLoCFcOh4Aod4ykAmQ">Uno Natural Linen Napkin, CB2</a>. </strong> Of course, we love color, but texture - oooh, love that too!  Nothing is quite so wonderfully textured as a natural linen cloth, softening with every wash and perfectly, peacefully neutral amidst a riot of color.

<strong>4.  <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_45&amp;products_id=379">Tropical Gardens Dinner Napkins</a>.</strong>  Beautiful Indian styled flowers in red will resonate beautifully with the rich colors of  Spice Route.  I like the contrast in scale of these pretty little flowers along side the bold geometric pattern of the tablecloth.

<h3>Accessories and Recipes</h3>

Oh, and have I mentioned we have <strong>fabulous ideas for accessorizing your Thanksgiving table?</strong>  From exotic window treatments to eclectic tableware, natural centerpieces and global recipes.
