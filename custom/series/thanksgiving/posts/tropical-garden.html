Warm up to our vibrant, hand-printed Tropical Garden tablecloth this Thanksgiving.  All the bounty of the season is gathered in each rich hue of this garden, and it is sure to inspire your unique decorating style.

We know that our customers are far from "one size fits all".  So along with our unique, handcrafted table linens, we'd like to share ideas for creating three distinct looks.  Of course, mixing and matching is always encouraged!   Celebrate!

<strong>1.   <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_52&amp;products_id=230">Tropical Garden Round Tablecloth</a>. </strong>It doesn't get much more festive than this.  Bright, hand printed flowers in rich, natural tones make your table all about the bounty of the harvest.  Use a large, round tablecloth at your dining table, or a smaller version at a round dessert or beverage table.

<strong>2.  <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_45&amp;products_id=346">Spice Route Dinner Napkins, Saffron Marigold</a>. </strong>Because our bohemian spirits love pattern, we'll layer it on with a tribal chevron print.  Our artisan made <strong>Spice Route napkins</strong> will connect to the color and tone of your tablecloth, but will introduce a new level of exotic to your dinner.

<strong>3.  <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/96739431/pumpkin-orange-linen-napkins-set-of-4">Pumpkin Orange Linen Napkins, Imali</a>  </strong>Handwoven linen napkins are a staple of Eastern European design, and in our global marketplace, we're now lucky to be able to find them almost anywhere!  (Thank-you, Etsy! :) )  I love the fall color of this set, in pumpkin orange.

<strong>4.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Couleur-Nature-Medallion-Kelly-Napkins/dp/B00B1JY62C/ref=sr_1_20?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1382892584&amp;sr=1-20">Couleur Nature Medallion Napkins, Couleur Nature</a>. </strong>Handprinted grass green medallions will be a lovely foil to the warm foliage of our Tropical Garden linens.  If you're serving a few meals in a row (say dinner and next day breakfast), it's always nice to have a new set of napkins ready to go.  Which would you choose?

<h3>Accessories and Recipes</h3>

Have I mentioned we have <strong>fabulous ideas for accessorizing your Thanksgiving table?</strong> From exotic window treatments to eclectic tableware, natural centerpieces and global recipes.  Try a few of these ideas, and your Bohemian style dinner is sure to be warm, welcoming and wonderful.

<strong>1.  <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=25&amp;products_id=855">Tropical Garden Sheer Curtain (complement)</a>.  </strong>If you're interested in creating a whole new scene in your dining room this holiday season, consider the boho wonder of our Tropical Garden complementary print.

<strong>2.  <a href="http://www.wayfair.com/Ten-Strawberry-Street-Aztec-13-Charger-Plate-AZT-340-BLK-SLV-TSW1304.html">Aztec Charger, Wayfair</a>. </strong>It's so fun to have a few sets of wild chargers on hand for entertaining... they'll transform the most functional white plating into fascinating and alluring tableware.

<strong>3.  <strong><a href="http://glitterinc.com/2011/11/vintage-can-centerpieces/">Vintage Can Centerpiece, Glitter Inc.</a> </strong></strong>This idea is a favorite of mine.  Scour your local thrift store, eBay and Etsy for vintage cans (or <a href="http://www.thelabelman.com/index.php?cPath=54">make your own with vintage labels</a>) and dress  them up with vibrant market flowers.  Perfect for a boho Thanksgiving.

<strong>4.  <a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/lattice-crusted-minestrone-pot-pies">Lattice Crusted Minestrone Pot Pie, Food and Wine</a>. </strong>Now the bohemian hostess not only loves her eclectic decor, but she loves to surprise friends and family with unusual and tasty foods.  This lattice crusted minestrone makes for a beautiful and delicious vegetarian offering.

<h3>Table Linens</h3>

Of course, we at Saffron Marigold love the beauty of hand made, hand touched works.  This is, after all, why we are preserving the ancient art of Indian block printing!  Let's get our Handmade Thanksgiving started by choosing from three lovely hand made napkins.  Any of which will be a lovely accompaniment to your Tropical Garden table cloth!

You can re-create this one by combining varieties of dark red tulips, bi-colored orange and yellow roses,  yellow freesia and Ilex berries.  Set these beauties off in a vase, a well loved watering can, or  even a hollowed out pumpkin.  By the way,  these flowers, or similar counterparts can be found at most local florists.</span></span>

4. <strong><a href="http://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/sweet-potato-pie-10000001548551/index.html">Sweet Potato Pie, Real Simple</a></strong>.I have a friend who makes the <em>best</em> sweet potato pie.  She uses a recipe on a well worn card, handed down from her Southern grandma.  This recipe from Real Simple highlights the same citrus notes that my friend's pie does, and looks - well - easy as pie to put together!

<h3>Table Linens</h3>

The theme of this print is nature's bounty, so it only follows that we'd be able to create a wonderful theme of nature-inspired pieces and organic materials.  If you're more likely to be found outside digging in the dirt, or taking a hike, then these ideas are for you.

1.  <b><a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=62&amp;products_id=676">Tropical Garden Kitchen Curtain</a>.  </b>Your dining room may lend itself to using a shorter kitchen curtain--an excellent choice if you want to let in light and catch some glimpses of the colors of fall out of your  Thanksgiving windows.

2.  <b><a href="http://www.leewolfepottery.com/products/owl-casserole-wheel-thrown-hand-sculpted">Wheel Thrown, Hand Sculpted Owl Casserole, Lee Wolfe Pottery. </a>  </b>Could this be any cuter?

3.  <b><a href="http://thecraftyhostess.com/?p=1900">Candle Boat with Fall Foliage, The Crafty Hostess.</a> </b>What a great idea!  This crafter has combined a candle boat with tiny bud vases to create the perfect centerpiece for a long table.  The height is just right, and small bright flowers among flickering candles will create a wonderful scene at your Thanksgiving table.
