Can a print that has "summer" in its name be used for Fall and Thanksgiving? If the print has lovely fall inspired hues like mango, saffron and rose, then the answer is a definite "yes".

With lush colors and exotic paisley patterning, Indian Summer will see you through the end of the holiday season with its festive hues. Though the print has a definite Indian vibe to it, don't be fooled. The print will work just as well in a Moroccan or global decor.

We offer you tablecloths--both <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_29&amp;products_id=330">rectangular</a> and <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_52&amp;products_id=331">round</a>, as well as a <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_56&amp;products_id=351">runner</a> and <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_45&amp;products_id=332">napkins</a> in this collection.

We're offering 3 decor styles to design your table around this lovely print.

<h3>Table Linens</h3>

Kilims, kanthas, suzanis....these are words you have no doubt heard being tossed around in the design arena. Just another sign that designing your space is no longer limited to pretty chintzes and floral pillows. Tap into the <strong>global</strong> vibe of Indian Summer by pairing with linens that speak of travel and adventure, of spices and curries...you get the idea? :-)

<h3>Table Linens</h3>
If you like lanterns and riads and rose petals and saffron, <strong>Moroccan</strong> is your style of choice! Not a style for the minimalist, its all about mixing colors and patterns exuberantly while boasting an aesthetic that has African, Persian and European influences. Moroccan style is beautiful, ornate, and warm.
