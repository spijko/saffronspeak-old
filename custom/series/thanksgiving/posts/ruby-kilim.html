<strong>1.  <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=25&amp;products_id=851">Ruby Kilim Sheer Cotton Curtain</a> (complementary print).  </strong>The gorgeous complement to our Ruby Kilim print may be just the element you need in your dining room to tease out the creative, free-spirited look you want.  A panel at the window or in a door way will transform your space into an exotic, warm space that is out of this world. (Or at least out of suburbia!)

<strong>2.  <a href="http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/product/home-serve-drink/973344.jsp#/">Beast's Feast Tureen, Anthropologie. </a> </strong>This is a wonderfully fun and funky piece.

<strong>3.  <strong> <a href="http://littlepheasant.blogspot.com/2010/02/feather-centerpieces.html">Feather Centerpiece, by Denise of Little Pheasant.</a></strong> </strong>Wow - this is beautiful.  The floral designer who crafted this did twenty or so for a friends' wedding.  She gives general instructions on her blog, but a tutorial on wreath making might help too.  A good one can be found <a href="http://www.bhg.com/holidays/christmas/crafts/wreaths/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<strong>4.  <strong><a href="http://almostturkish.blogspot.com/2007/09/thracian-roasted-eggplant-sald-tun.html">Turkish Roasted Eggplant Salad, by Almost Turkish</a>.</strong> </strong>This cold salad combines eggplant, peppers, tomatoes, parsley and vinegar.  Crusty warm bread is an essential companion.  Add this to the collection of traditional side-dishes at your Thanksgiving table, and you're sure to catch the interest of your guests!

<h3>Table Linens</h3>
Of course, we at Saffron Marigold love the beauty of hand made, hand touched works.  This is, after all, why we are preserving the ancient art of Indian block printing!  Let's get our Handmade Thanksgiving started by choosing from three lovely hand printed linen napkins.  Any of which will be a lovely accompaniment to your Ruby Kilim table cloth!

1.  <strong><a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=28_38&amp;products_id=834">Ruby Kilim Euro Sham</a> (complementary print)</strong>.  This sham is definitely one of my favorites.  Use a large pillow like this to create a far-eastern look in your dining room.  Pile a trio in a corner or on an adjacent sofa.  You'll soften your space, add interest, and make for comfy post-dinner seating (or sleeping).

2.  <a href="http://www.worldmarket.com/product/round-madras-chargers-set-of-4.do?&amp;from=fn"><strong>Round Madras Chargers, World Market</strong></a>.

4.<strong>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/turkeycurry_78850">Turkey Curry - BBC Food</a>. </strong>Here's an idea...  many of celebrate with a few different groups of friends or family over the Thanksgiving holidays.  If you've already carved a turkey, and are having guests the next day, why not serve a savory, rich turkey curry?  I know<em> I</em> would be grateful for the change of pace if I were your guest. :)
