To lay eyes on Pacific Blue, or to touch it with your hands, is to fall in love.  This fabulously unique print is lovely for Thanksgiving because of its warm, rustic look, and because the rich indigo color is a perfect foil for the russets, ochers and reds of harvest season.

We know that our customers are far from "one size fits all". So along with our unique, handcrafted table linens, we'd like to share ideas for creating three distinct looks. Of course, mixing and matching is always encouraged! Celebrate!

<a name="bohemian"><img class="borderless" src="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/PB-Banner-boho.jpg.jpg.jpg" alt="Bohemian Pacific Blue" />

<h3>Table Linens</h3>
If you're a free-spirited hostess who loves vintage style, ethnic pieces, bold pattern and rich color, Pacific Blue will add just the right Bohemian vibe to your table.  Use it as a ground for bright plating and accessories, or tie into the creamy cotton and use natural fibers and vintage wood pieces on top.

<strong>1.   <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_52&amp;products_id=613">Pacific Blue Round Tablecloth. </a> </strong>Round tables seem to create a special warmth, and topping that table with a unique, hand made table cloth will set just the festive scene that you imagine for your family and friends.  No run of the mill, polyester tablecloth will do for you!  Instead, choose our heirloom quality, artisan made indigo cotton for your family Thanksgiving. 

<strong>2.  <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_45&amp;products_id=346">Spice Route Dinner Napkins, Saffron Marigold</a>. </strong>Because our bohemian spirits love pattern, we'll layer it on with a tribal chevron print.  Our artisan made <strong>Spice Route napkins</strong> are a bright contrast to Pacific Blue, and will introduce a new level of exotic to your dinner.

<strong>3.  <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/90076618/rolling-waves-dinner-napkins?ref=shop_home_active_21">Rolling Waves Batik Dinner Napkins, Margot Bianca.</a>  I</strong>f you're entertaining for several meals, consider using these batiked, naturally dyed linens for a  breakfast or lunch.  You'll create a completely new look and the colors are perfect for Fall atop Pacific Blue.

<strong>4.  <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/157614035/napkin-set-of-4-or-6-hand-screen-printed?ref=sr_gallery_35&amp;ga_search_query=hand+printed+napkins&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_ship_to=US&amp;ga_search_type=handmade">Screen Printed Eco Friendly Linen Napkin, Tongue in Chic Home. </a>  </strong>I love these simple, screen printed floral napkins.  The creamy ground will be soft against Pacific Blue, and the printed flower will hum along with our indigo dye.  By the way, this artist will custom print her linens in a variety of colors, so let your imagination run wild, and then order a set of napkins!

<h3>Accessories and Recipes</h3>

<strong>1.  <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=25&amp;products_id=607">Pacific Blue Sheer Cotton Curtain. </a> </strong>Perhaps an adjacent room could use a new look.

<strong>2. <a href="http://www.novica.com/itemdetail/index.cfm?pid=94076&amp;re=producta">Talaveras "Carnation" Serving Plate, Novica. </a>  </strong>Add a little heat and spice to your table with a set of Talaveras plates.  I warn you, once you start browsing around for Talaveras pottery, you'll be hooked.  So many colors and patterns!  Just the perfect bit of sizzle for your Bohemian Thanksgiving.

<strong>3.  <a href="http://www.designsponge.com/2012/10/entertaining-fall-flower-centerpiece-and-place-setting.html">Fall Floral Centerpiece, Design Sponge</a>.  </strong>This is one of my all time favorite centerpiece ideas.  The creatives at Design Sponge have used a <a href="http://www.enasco.com/product/SB48384M">wire test tube rack</a> and filled the glass tubes with grasses and fall flowers.  What a look!  Can my flower children friends agree that this is awesome?!

<strong>4. <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/10/apple-and-caramel-aged-gouda-crostata.html">Apple Caramel Gouda Crostata, Serious Eats.</a>  </strong>Crostata, the rustic, happily imperfect cousin of the pie, is my go-to fall dessert.  Thanksgivings will certainly flow if you serve this beauty at your celebration!

<h3>Table Linens</h3>

If you love to travel, or even just to dream of far off places, than you'll understand the vision behind Pacific Blue.  Imagined on the California coast, this print surveys the beautiful Pacific as it rises and falls all the way to the Far East. You'll be reminded of rustic Japanese forms and enjoy the metaphor of uncharted waters as you decorate your Thanksgiving table around this hand printed beauty.

While everyone is certainly grateful for family and home, I'm sure that in your global space, at least a few will begin to daydream of their next vacation. :)

2.  <b><a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_45&amp;products_id=429">Ocean Breezes Dinner Napkins, Saffron Marigold.</a>  </b>Add a bit of Moroccan flair to your world-wide Thanksgiving by using our  hand printed Ocean Breezes cotton napkins.  You'll catch glimpses of Moroccan tile, and have the sense that the sea is just outside your coastal villa.

3.  <a href="http://www.crateandbarrel.com/mehendi-maya-napkin/s183134"><strong>Mehendi Maya Napkin, Crate &amp; Barrel.</strong> </a><strong> </strong>This elaborate mehendi pattern is so beautiful against our Pacific Blue.  Pull out all the stops for global design with this exciting print!

I can't help but have a special place in my heart for these handmade shibori linens.  In no way "matchy-matchy", they'll lend a consistency to your aesthetic that will surely resonate in your welcoming space.

<h3>Accessories and Recipes</h3>

While Thanksgiving is a distinctly North American holiday, it certainly has come to represent the beauty of our multi-cultural country.  Why not take that to the next level and really play up a global theme at your Thanksgiving dinner?  Incorporate the traditions of the "melting-pot" along with those early American traditions, and you'll find that you're creating a new tradition that you and your family will cherish.

1.  <strong><a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=28_38&amp;products_id=617">Pacific Blue Euro Sham. </a> </strong>Extra large euro sham pillows, around a low coffee table create quite a zen look, as well as extra seating for unexpected guests!  Consider Pacific Blue in a space that has an eastern sensibility, or a rugged global vibe.

2.  <strong><a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/nito-basket-handle/?cm_src=AutoRel">Nito Basket with Handles, Williams and Sonoma. </a>  </strong>Notice how the woven pattern of this natural fiber basket imitates the print of Pacific Blue? Using this Philippine serving dish will create an understated consistency in your space.

3.  <strong><a href="http://www.bollea.com/lantern-centerpiece">Flower Studded Lantern Centerpiece, Bollea. </a>  </strong>Lanterns are a sure fire way to create a "traveller's" look at your table, but how about this dressed up version?

4. <strong><a href="http://food52.com/recipes/19854-yam-and-peanut-stew-with-kale">Yam and Peanut Stew with Kale, Food 52. </a>  </strong>Yams and peanuts are staples of many African diets, but I must say, they're flavors that Westerners love as well!

<h3>Table Linens</h3>

Pacific Blue is inspired by natural beauty, so it only follows that we'd be able to create a wonderful theme of nature-inspired pieces and organic materials.  If you're more likely to be found outside staring at the sea, or climbing a mountain, then these ideas are for you.
