Along with the traditions of generosity, gratitude and lingering with family around the Thanksgiving table, why not add a touch of something fabulously new, unique and gorgeous?  Our bold, Moroccan inspired Casablanca collection (in <strong><a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/CASA_BLUE/948/moroccan-quatrefoil-blue-bedding-curtains-table-linens.php">blue</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/collection_page.php?cPath=59&amp;model=CASA&amp;products_id=949">white</a></strong>) are just the springboard for the delightful, global table of your dreams! We know that our customers are far from "one size fits all".  So along with our unique, handcrafted table linens, we'd like to share ideas for creating three distinct looks.  Of course, mixing and matching is always encouraged!  Celebrate!

It's hard to choose, I know, but each one is wonderful! Are you ready?

<h3>Table Linens</h3>

Of course, we at Saffron Marigold love the beauty of hand made, hand touched works.  This is, after all, why we are preserving the ancient art of Indian block printing!  Let's get our Handmade Thanksgiving started by choosing from three lovely hand made napkins.  Any of which will be a lovely accompaniment to your Casablanca table runner!

A few handcrafted pieces at your table will go far in extending the authentic look you're creating.

<strong>3.  <a href="http://vases.novica.com/ceramic/favorites/ceramic-vases-san-antonio-blossom-pair/175578/">San Antonia Vases, Novica.</a>  </strong>I love these simply hand painted vases for fall decor.  Again, these embody the nexus of rustic design and bold color.  Fill the vases with orange and russet mums and marigolds for a look that reads "fall colors and blue skies".

<strong>4. <a href="http://withstyleandgraceblog.com/2012/01/02/market-monday-healthy-winter-chop-chop-salad/"> Winter Chop Salad, With Style and Grace Blog.</a>  </strong>Apples, pears, persimmons and pomegranates atop a bed of cabbage and romaine make for a salad that explodes with flavor, and is a delight to the eyes at the same time.

You'll create a fresh, light look, founded in a palette that is a perfect foil for the rich, warm colors of harvest foods.

2. <strong><a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_45&amp;products_id=661">Vanilla Glacé Dinner Napkins, Saffron Marigold.</a></strong> Our white and gold Moroccan style dinner napkins will add a touch of sparkle and elegance to your feast.

3. <strong><a href="http://www.dransfieldandross.biz/search_products.asp?page=1">Linen Wave Edge Napkin, Dransfield and Ross</a>.</strong>Play up the moss green accents in your tablecloth with this soft, uniquely bordered dinner napkin. These linens will translate "sophisticated <em>and</em> playful".

4. <strong><a href="http://www.thelinennapkin.com/products-page/cotton-napklns/casablanca-cotton-napkin/">Casablanca Napkins, The Linen Napkin.</a></strong> Is green more your thing?  Then accessorize your table with "Casablanca" napkins from the Linen Napkin.  While not quite our avocado tone, the fresh hue and Moroccan motif of these napkins will be a charming addition to your table.

<h3>Accessories and Recipes</h3>

Round out the Casablanca feel of your dining room with some well placed trimmings.  Use colors of the sea and shore along side the warm, bold colors of the sun and of harvest.

Since everyone wants to relax and rest after Thanksgiving dinner anyhow, why not create a designated space for lounging?  Your guests will thank you and remember you for it.

3.  <strong><a href="http://shopnectar.com/product-moroccan-tea-light-candleholder-sets">Moroccan Tea Light Set, Nectar.</a></strong> For the centerpiece at this table, go simple and low with a line up of etched Moroccan tea lights.  If you want to add flowers, cut fresh stems very short and place them directly on the table around the votives.

4. <strong><a href="http://www.coastalliving.com/food/kitchen-assistant/best-side-dishes-00414000068256/page20.html">Moroccan Carrots, Coastal Living.</a></strong> I am so happy with this recipe.
