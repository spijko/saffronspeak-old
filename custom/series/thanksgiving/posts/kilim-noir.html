<h3>Table Linens</h3>

<strong>Eastern decor embraces different cultures</strong> and does not focus on a single or specific region. The use of color is one of the most dramatic characteristics of this decor style. Kilim Noir's black and gold table linens will make a stunning impact when paired with vibrant and vivid napkins from Saffron Marigold's napkin collection.

The deep red glaze blends beautifully with the red of the print, and the earthy rustic finish complements the glamorous print.

I can tell you from experience that it is an absolute gastronomic masterpiece. Roasted eggplants are stuffed with onions, tomatoes, parsley and dill, and served warm with a drizzle of olive oil. Serve with some couscous and kebabs and you have a meal fit for a Caliph!

<h3>Table Linens</h3>

<h3>Table Linens</h3>

The <strong>hand crafted Kilim Noir table runner</strong> is a great way to add texture and color, especially if you are "fabric phobic" when it comes to setting a table. A table without a tablecloth and just a runner is a bold move that will define your entire theme. Handmade decor is all about enriching your daily life with high quality products you feel passionate about.
