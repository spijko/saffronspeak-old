<h3>Table Linens</h3>

Memories of Shalimar has an intrinsically <strong>Asian</strong> feel to it with its oriental floral motifs outlined in gold. Restful and soothing, the play of colors works best with Zen accessories that speak of tranquility and calm. Channel all the elements of nature - stones, water, flowers - and bring out the best in this print.
