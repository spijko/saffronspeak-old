I think that guest rooms are fun to decorate.  Often, these rooms remain empty canvases until guests are imminent, and inspiration strikes! (Or at least we hope it does...) Today, I'll assist your inspiration by showcasing our most sultry, dramatic print: <strong><a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=21_35&amp;products_id=214">Kilim Noir</a>.</strong>  This Moroccan black, gold and red pattern is royal, global, and altogether stunning.

You'll love the curtains or a duvet in a room with gold or red toned walls, and your guests will love feeling like they've stepped into an exotic hideaway.

The collection has euros and throws, fun little items that will spoil and pamper your guests. The curtain panels are also offered <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=25&amp;products_id=843">in a complementary print</a> - a tribal, creamy zig zag print set against a deep black ground. Mix and match accessories from our other kilim inspired print <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/R_KILIM/527/red-black-kilim-bedding-table-linens.php">Ruby Kilim</a> and see how exotic the room will look!

To create a cohesive theme, I suggest playing off of the ancient, earthy motifs in this pattern. Gather some pieces like the following  to touch on this notion of global comfort, and watch your guests ooh and ahh and sleep oh, so soundly.
