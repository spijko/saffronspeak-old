Here is a print that will make your house guests feel so good. Whatever linens the guest bed is dressed up in, <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=25&amp;products_id=132">Ivy Lace curtains</a> will complement them and imbue the room with the fresh, creamy goodness that only white linens can bring. If the bedspreads and duvets are white, this print will only enhance that dewy freshness, if on the other hand your guest bed is decked out in colorful linens, Ivy Lace will bring a clam, neutrality to the room. So either way, its a win win situation :-)

<h3>Guest Room Suggestion of the day</h3>

<blockquote>
  Don't Try to Do It All. There's no better way to make a house guest feel uncomfortable than to be working, cleaning, and cooking the whole time your guests are with you. Give you and your guests a chance to relax and really enjoy each other. No one will care if the kitchen is sparkling or the sheets are ironed. And when there is work to do, accept every offer wash the dishes or set the table. Be a team and let everyone enjoy!
