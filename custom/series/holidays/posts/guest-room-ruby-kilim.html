    While the Ruby Kilim main print is bold and graphic, the complementary print is a softer take on that boldness. But equally stunning.

<h3>Guest Room Suggestion of the day</h3>

<blockquote>
  You don't want your guests to walk into the room and find there's no light to read by! It's always nice to have a light control near the bed, so your guest won't have to stumble around in the dark, just to turn a light on. If nothing else, provide a good reading light near a chair or over the bed. Another fixture or lamp near the desk would be great. A small night light is helpful and a lighted magnifying make-up mirror is a real luxury!
