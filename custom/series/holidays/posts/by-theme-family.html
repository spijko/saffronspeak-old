I occasionally like to do family gifts at the holidays.  It's fun to think of something that everyone will enjoy and that everyone can enjoy together!  If you are putting together gifts for a special couple or family with kids, we've got some unique ideas for you!  Start with one of our <strong>Dreams of India Collection euro shams</strong>.  (Or two, or three! :) )  These are bright, cheery and generously sized washable pillow covers which will instantly brighten a room as well as provide great floor seating!  Add a <strong>fun game</strong> and <strong>yummy snack</strong>, and you've got the perfect gift package for any family!

<h3>Family Gift Set #1:  Jeweled Peacock</h3>

What's not to love about our <strong>dazzling turquoise sham</strong>?  It's bold, it's zesty, and a perfect launching pad for an intense game of <strong>Hearts or Gin</strong>.  My only caution is that kids may fight over it.  Adults may too!  You may need to purchase a couple in order to keep the peace. :)  Of course, once the family is busy munching on their <strong>Love with Food goodies</strong>, good will should be restored.

<h3>Family Gift Set #2:  Gilded Chocolate</h3>

The name of this <em>Dreams of India</em> sham alone is enough to cause many to purchase it!  One look at the <strong>rich cocoa color, flecked and striped with gold</strong> seals the deal.  This sham will be lovely in a global home as well as in a modern space that loves bold color.  Your lucky family will want to settle in on their cushions while they play <strong>Ticket to Ride, India</strong>.  If you've never played these games by Days of Wonder, you're missing out!  They are a blast, and teach some decent strategy and geography along the way.  Of course, everyone will want to munch on delicious <strong>gourmet popcorn from Crazy But True</strong>, in flavors like Coconut Curry and Caramel with a Kick!

<h3>Family Gift Set #3: The Maharani's Rubies</h3>

Choose our delightfully <strong>raspberry colored euro sham</strong> for a family filled with girl power.  Each little princess will love a turn on her fancy, soft throne!  They'll snuggle down for hours while they're playing <strong>Story Cubes</strong> - a super fun way to generate creativity and often lots of laughs.  It's possibly true that ice cream should be included in any family gift package, but since I've only included it in one, it has to be from <strong>Jeni's</strong>.  They'll never forget their first Jeni's... and if a drip falls onto the Maharani's Rubies sham, well then, just toss it in the wash!  It couldn't be more perfect.

<h3>Family Gift Set #4: The Empresses Emeralds</h3>

A glimmering kelly green euro sham will be right at home under the Christmas tree, and may well end up being one of favorite gifts this year!  Mom will love it for its beauty, the kids will be thrilled to have a floor pillow, and Dad will sneak it away to nap on while he catches up on weekend news!  Pull our generous euro sham out for extra seating when everyone is gathered round playing Qwirkle.  This is a deceptively challenging game that brings out the competitor in almost everyone.  If anyone is sad about losing, she'll cheer right up when the gingerbread house decorations begin! What a fun holiday you've made! And to think it all started with a euro sham. :)
