<h3>Guest Room Suggestion of the Day</h3>

<blockquote>
  Nothing says welcome like a basket of treats. Your guests will appreciate having fresh fruits, crackers, cookies and bottled water available to them in their room. If they like coffee, you could even set up a small coffee station with a single or two-cup coffee maker, cups, and all the fixings. They may want to enjoy a cup in the morning before they come out to see everyone.
