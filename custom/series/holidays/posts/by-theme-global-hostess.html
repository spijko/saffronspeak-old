The Holiday season is always busy, but in such a fun way.  There are all kinds of parties and dinners and drop-ins and festivities.  This year, I've been gathering a stash of hostess gifts, so I can say "thanks for having us" easily, and at a moment's notice.

First off, Saffron Marigold offers a great selection of really interesting, luxury cotton table linens.  They are hand printed in India, and are all made using fair trade practices.  Any of these would make a memorable gift for your favorite entertainer, however <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=43_29&amp;products_id=83">Ruby Kilim</a> (shown below) is a particularly wonderful holiday gift.

You can see our entire collection of table linens <a href="http://www.saffronmarigold.com/catalog/gateway.php?cPath=43">here</a>.

The gift collection I've created here is geared toward the hosts and hostesses who are a little out of the ordinary (in a good way).  Travel, authentic experiences and any thing handmade or fair trade are the things that bring delight to this person... These gifts reflect their delights.
